    <h2>Milanesas a la napolitana</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to the Austrian wiener schnitzel, the Italian cotoletta alla
      Milanese, and the Japanese tonkatsu, the Argentinian milanesa is also a
      breaded cutlet shallow-fried in oil. The cutlet typically comes either
      from the round or from the eye of the round, which are lean cuts, meaning
      they have less fat, marbling, and sinew when compared to most other cuts
      of beef.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Beef</li>
      <li>Breadcrum</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Cured Ham</li>
      <li>Mozzarella</li>
      <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Oregano</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat the cutlets to the desired thickness.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk the eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large shallow container,
        pour the breadcrumbs on a large, flat plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        First, dip the cutlets into the egg mixture, and then coat them with
        breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the breaded cutlets on a plate, then place the plate in the
        refrigerator between several hours to up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour a half an inch of oil into the pan, and then heat it over
        medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the cutlets in oil, in batches, 5-7 minutes on one side, and then
        for another five minutes when you flip them, until golden. Transfer the
        finished cutlets onto paper towels to drain.
      </li>
      <li>Arrange the cutlets in a baking tray.</li>
      <li>
        Top each first with prosciutto, one to two slices, then spread them with
        a 1/4 cup (65g) of tomato sauce, and lastly, top with mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the broiler, then place the baking tray under it for 5-9
        minutes, then serve.
      </li>
